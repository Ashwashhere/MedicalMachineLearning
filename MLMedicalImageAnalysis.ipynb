See the assignment specification for full details (including the extension exercise for first class marks).\n","\n","It's always fine to add new code/text cell pairs in order to do each of these things. Don't worry if you duplicate some aspect of another code cell - it's not a problem and the separation can help keep what you're doing clear and avoid breaking earlier code. On the other hand, if you prefer to make improvements directly to pre-existing cells (e.g., modifying the \"Model 1 Evaluation\" section above so that it evaluates a range of different hyperparameter settings) then that's absolutely fine too. You don't lose credit for earlier grade bands, because their criteria are still met by the improved code. (The only exception is that you could set out to improve a code listing, but end up breaking it - try to avoid making big changes close to the deadline.)\n","\n","Whichever approach you take to extending your code, make sure you add/update associated text cells as needed, and update the conclusion at the end of your notebook to reflect your findings.\n","\n","## Top marks\n","\n","If you work towards the very highest available marks by critically analysing the colleague statement (see the assignment specification for full details), then you are free to add as many code/text cells as you wish. These might be standard code/text cell pairs like the ones above (e.g., producing experimental findings with a relevant dataset) or they might be text cells in isolation (e.g., presenting findings from your research/reading and/or setting out your analysis). A bit of both is likely to be needed for the very top marks. You are also likely to start citing and referencing other materials as part of this work, and so you will have citations within the body of the notebook, and a final \"References\" text cell at the end (one has been left below as a reminder)."],"metadata":{"id":"x2mVzvGrni8O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# References\n","\n","If you draw from other sources then you need to properly cite and reference them Cite Them Right Harvard.
